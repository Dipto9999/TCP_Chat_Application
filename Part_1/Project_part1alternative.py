"""
    This program implements a variety of the snake
    game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))

    The model of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) implemented has been changed from message passing to shared-memory.
    Similar to Labs 5 & 6, we are using mutexes (i.e. locks in a dict) to protect read-write access to the memory instead of the `queue`
    from the original design.

    This entails a separate thread for Game superloop in a reader-writer synchronization problem. Access to the 4 data fields (i.e. game_over, score, prey, move)
    is protected by a critical section. This is updated with logic in the Game class, and read by the GUI class to render its state.

    Note that GUI access has been designed to have non-blocking mutex acquires for all fields other than game_over (i.e. if game has not ended).
    If a certain lock from the dict cannot be acquired (i.e. data being written to when context-switch occurs), it is momentarily skipped in favor of updating other GUI components.
    This is done through scheduling an update every 100ms to behave similarly to the queue in the original program design.

    **IMPORTANT** Tkinter is NOT thread-safe. To handle GUI updates, we use the Tk.after(...) method to achieve scheduling functionality. This is the same as in the original Part 1 design.
