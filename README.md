## Overview
We developed a chat application in **Python** to implement a **Client-Server Model** via **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**. We built this to meet the following base requirement :

<b>The chat service provider (i.e. server) must be able to manage multiple clients in the system without a significant drop in performance.</b>

## Program Design

The server and clients are managed via `multiprocessing` as these represent seperate entities (i.e. each have their own code section and **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**).

Handshakes are performed and messages are handled (i.e. received/sent from client to server) via `multithreading` for concurrency.

### Disconnections

There has been error handling implemented for both the chat server and clients to appropriately handle disconnections, including a client leaving the system, as well as server shutdown.

We have implemented this, such that the same client can attempt reconnection and communicate via a reestablished server application.

### Synchronization

The server threads which handle client messages implement **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** via *memory sharing*. They have read-write access to the `socketInfo` data field, which is a `list` of `dicts` (i.e. with the `socket` object and `address` tuple).

If a client socket is closed and a server thread is unable to successfully send a message, it removes the socket information from the `socketInfo` data field in a critical section.

This is to ensure other threads are made aware of this client leaving the system, as well as to avoid subsequent communication attempts by the current thread.

### UML Sequence Diagram

We have illustrated the following **UML Sequence Diagram** to describe the high-level interactions in our program.

<i>Note that all connections and disconnections are implemented via **TCP**.</i>
